      <h1>GREETINGS</h1>
      <p>
        I'm <strong>Michael</strong> and welcome to my digital resume extension (that I coded from scratch and pushed <br>to the web <a style="color:blue;" href="https://youtu.be/6JgOP9fvfog?t=53">myself</a>).
        <br><br><u>Not bad for a marketer, eh?</u><br><br>

        Anyways- if you're reading this, I've likely expressed an active interest in working with you, your colleagues, and your clients.<br><br>

        Here's what I think: as a manager or<br> C-suite executive, <em>you</em> want what <em>I</em> want.
        We can be real vague & nicey-nice and call it - as the recruiters are so fond of saying - a <strong>great fit</strong>.<br><br>

        But who would that serve?<br><br>

        <div class="largeimages">
          <img src="images/sadpuppy.jpg"><br><br><br>
        </div>
        <p style="font-size:20px"><em>Certainly not this pouty prince.</em></p>
      </p>

        <br>_______
    </div>
    <div class="opening2">
        <h1>How about we speak in plain language?</h1><br>

        <p>I'd wager the person you're looking for harbors essential characteristics
           that go beyond the ethereal "wonderful communication skills" or brute
           force tactics like "hustle".<br><br>

           In general, it's almost always somewhere in between, and you know it when you see it.<br><br>

           It's been my experience that the most enjoyable and effective colleagues always embody these qualities:</p>

        <blockquote>
          - Keen insight to <strong>identify and rectify problems</strong> <em>prior</em> to them surfacing as problems<br><br>
          - Great <strong>social skills</strong> (particularly empathy, positivity, humor, and confidence) to get along swimmingly with others<br><br>
          - Deep knowledge into your <strong>industry trends</strong>, or the ability to rapidly gather that information<br><br>
          - <strong>Technical skills</strong> to leverage already-in-place technology<br><br>
          - Above-average <strong>communication and presentation skills</strong> that will assert leadership and "wow" clients<br><br>
        </blockquote><br><br>

        <p>
          And yes, I'm sure there's more. But a relationship is a two-way street.<br><br>

          So, in return for the services
          these star employees are offering - what do I think this called "great fit" should expect?<br><br>

          First, I think they should realize that most employers - at a bare minimum - are quite happy to reward
          this sort of employee with an inclusive working enviornment and financial
          stability.<br><br>

          What's important beyond those items?<br><br>

          I may not have all the answers - but I'll be damned if I don't try and
          obtain what will make me happy in this world.<br><br><br>


            <img src="images/lifeexpectancy.jpg"/>
            <p style="font-size:20px"><em>Yikes. Now's probably a good time to think about
            <strong>what I want out of a modern, professional life.</strong></em></p><br>


        </p>

        <blockquote>
          - <strong>Career growth & mentorship</strong>. I want to be consistently updating my LinkedIn with more impressive bullet points and job titles.<br><br>
          - <strong>Financial leverage</strong>. I have much to offer, and I expect to be fairly rewarded.<br><br>
          - <strong>Interesting, challenging problems</strong>. If I'm coasting on auto-pilot, something's wrong.<br><br>
          - <strong>Vacations</strong>. I'm young and very much knee deep in the work-hard-play-hard mentality. Does this change as one ages?<br><br>
          - <strong>Dynamic social interactions</strong>. We're social creatures that spend most of our waking life working. So, in this department I insist on quality.<br><br>
          - <strong>Opportunities for skill development</strong>. Nothing in life remains the same, and I'd quite like <em>not</em> to be automated out of business at 50.<br><br>
        </blockquote>

        <h1>If you've gotten this far...</h1>
        <p>Perhaps you're considering clicking around my site to learn more about my professional whereabouts. I'm flattered.<br><br>
           Or maybe you're getting a weird vibe that you can't <em>quite</em> put your finger on. You just know
           you're <em>not enjoying it.</em><br><br>

           Hey- that works, too. And it's one less resum&eacute; in the stack to dig through.<br><br>

           Either way, enjoy.<br><br>
           :)<br><br>
