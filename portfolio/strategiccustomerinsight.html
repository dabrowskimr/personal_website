          <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Overview:</h3>
            <p>Nationwide Children's Hospital wanted to improve<br> their <strong>physician recruitment
            processes</strong>.</p>
            <p>I worked with them to narrow down a scope that pressed on their understanding
            of <strong>different types of doctors</strong> who are conceivable candidates.</p>
            <p>While they had <strong>some knowledge</strong> of who they were trying to recruit, it was clear
            that their insight into the lives, drives, and passions of doctors was <strong>relatively limited</strong>.</p>
            <p>It would be important to <strong>distinguish between physician types</strong> in an effort
            to greater <strong>personalize their recruitment efforts</strong>.</p>


            <br>

          <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Objectives:</h3>
            <p>Objective #1: Gain an understanding of various doctor personas through
            social media analysis, personal interviews, and press releases.</p>
            <p>Objective #2: Get to the heart of <strong>what drives these individuals</strong> on a day-to-day basis.</p>
            <p>Objective #3: Present a coherent report based on these findings,
            that explains exactly <strong>how to target these folks</strong>.</p><br>

          <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Target Audience:</h3>
            <p>This presentation was to be made directly to the hospital's <strong>marketing executives</strong>.</p><br>

          <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Results:</h3>
            <p><strong>Clear patterns emerged</strong>; by lumping physicians into one of the above
            categories, their marketing department now had the capacity to zero-in on
            their recruitment efforts.</p>
            <p>Based on this work, Nationwide commissioned me for <strong>another similar project</strong> -
            this time delving into how to improve <strong>patient targeting efforts</strong>.</p>

              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Overview:</h3>
                <p>Workiva, <strong>a public accounting SaaS solution</strong> that's designed
                for high-regulation environments, wanted to better understand their
                brand reputation, <strong>how their customers arrived at a purchasing decision</strong>,
                and how to optimally position their product in the <strong>sales process</strong>.</p>
                <p>I </p>
                <br>

              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Objectives:</h3>
                <p>Objective #1: Redesign outdated website and implement a <strong>cohesive
                  marketing strategy</strong> to create a modern communications
                  funnel.</p>

              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Audience Messaging:</h3>
                <p>I decided to highlight their brand's <strong>unique value offerings</strong>:
                <strong>extremely customizable systems</strong>, and <strong>delightful customer service</strong>
                representatives to help scientists navigate the complex process of integrating
                new technology with their existing workflow.</p><br>
              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Public Perceptions & Competitive Insight:</h3>
                <p>Workiva actually had a great reputation in online accounting circles for
                its easy to use interface and robust reporting capabilities.<br><br>
              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Plan:</h3>
                <p><strong>Collect data</strong> on brand perceptions and sales process insights
                from a variety of <strong>quantitative</strong> (e.g. public accounting software
                stats) and <strong>qualitative</strong> (e.g. accounting forums, social networks) sources.</p>
                <p>Integrate this data into current understandings of the
                Workiva<br><strong>customer decision journey</strong>.</p>
                <p>Analyze conversations about what's important when it comes to decision-makers
                <strong>assessing the purchas of an enterprise accounting solution</strong>.</p>
