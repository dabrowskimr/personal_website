          <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Project Overview:</h3>
          <p>The marketing research firm I work for was <strong>growing</strong>, and wanted
          what any evolving organization seeks - <strong>high-quality candidates</strong>
          who naturally excel at their work with limited direction.</p>
          <p>Granted, we had no trouble recieving dozens of resumes from candidates with
          <strong>business and marketing backgrounds</strong>.</p>
          <p>But while our brand of research & strategy work involves
           no shortage of marketing concepts, it hinges on the ability
          to effectively <strong>grasp behavioral analysis techniques</strong> and to <strong>translate this data into
          a cohesive narrative.</strong></p>
          <p>Examples of this work can be found <a href="../portfolio/strategiccustomerinsight.html">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Turns out that <strong>social science majors</strong> (think: sociology, psychology,
          anthropology) are significantly more apt to have these qualities based on their training.</p>
          <p>I knew this because that's the world myself and many of my colleagues came from.</p>
          <p>The problem is: they're often <strong>not interested in business</strong> (many are attracted
          to academic research, non profits, or community engagement roles), or simply are <strong>unaware
          of business opportunities</strong> that mesh well with their background.</p>
          <p>I set out to remedy this.</p><br>

        </div>

        <div class="portfolioexample">
          <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Objectives:</h3>
            <p>Objective #1: Design, facilitate, and implement a <strong>scalable recruitment
            process</strong> for internships and new hires.</p>
            <p>Objective #2: Create a <strong>self-sustaining pipeline of quality candidates</strong> with the right
            backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Objective #3: Show them how to become <strong>integral employees</strong> & on-demand contractors.<br><br>
          <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Target Audience:</h3>
            <p>University professors, students, and recent college grads.</p><br>
          <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Messaging:</h3>
            <p>There are two clear threads that unite Feedback's business aims with those of social science departments.</p>
            <p>Connection #1: The mission to give highly capable individuals <strong>professional opportunity</strong>.</p>
            <p>Connection #2: The aim to <strong>improve the experience of individuals</strong> by
            lifting up their voices, be it through healthcare marketing
            or social organization development.</p>
            <p>I knew that <strong>if these points were conveyed correctly</strong>, and professors truly cared about their
            students' interests & professional development, <strong>they would have no problem
            promoting the business opportunities we offer</strong>.</p><br>

          <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Plan:</h3>
            <p><strong>Leverage existing university connections</strong>. I guessed our issue might just
            be one of awareness, so I wanted to first reach out to personal mentors from
            my psychology department.</p>
            <p>I would ask them for <strong>introductions to colleagues</strong> who might be interested
            in spreading the word about our offerings, as well as advising student
            internships on the university side.</p>
            <p><strong>Create formal advertisements</strong> with messaging that speaks directly to those
            in the social science world. For instance - as a psychology undergrad, I certainly didn't have my sights set on business - that
            was until I came across companies that <strong>blended business with what I was learning</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Prep for failure</strong>. If my ideas didn't play out as expected (e.g. mentors weren't
            interested in sharing the company with students), I would have a process
            in place to deal with this.</p>
            <p>It would be very much based on a computer science-y <strong>"if this, then that" framework</strong>.</p><br>

          <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Results:</h3>
            <p><strong><em>Initial Response</em></strong></p>
            <p><strong>Messaging was spot on</strong>, and things went off without a hitch. Turns out, social science professors are actually interested in their
            students achieving success in the business world - if the opportunity is positioned correctly.</p>
            <p>From just a few emails to various department at universities across Virginia,
            I had <strong>university leaders contact me asking how they could help</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>My bosses</strong> were extremely thankful for the thoughtful work I put into this project,
            and continue to be impressed by amount of quality applicants.</p><br>
            <p><strong><em>Current Day</em></strong></p>
            <p>We've had countless people go through our internship program,
            many of which have become <strong>wonderful employees</strong>.</p>
            <p>My legwork has <strong>built up a network of contractors</strong> who
            we routinely call on for project work when times get busy. This is essential in the unpredictable advertising industry.</p>
            <p>I receive a <strong>steady stream of interested candidates</strong> each month.
            And this number only increases when we push out the highly targeted
            ads in university depts.</p>
            <p>Networks continue to <strong>grow in prominence</strong>: higher profile universities, departments,
            and interested individuals are springing up from more distant locations.</p>

          <h4><u>Exhibit B: Conference Logistics</u></h4>
        </div>

            <div class="portfolioexample">
              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Project Overview:</h3>
                <p>Picture this: you're hired into an organization and told you are now<br> in charge of all things marketing. (Awesome!)
                <p>You get to direct a network of creative and technical talent<br> toward creative aims. (Sounds great!)</p>
                <p>You are responsible for the ultimate "face" of the brand. (Totally prepared!)</p>
                <p>Oh, and by the way - within the first three months,<br> you have to make the arrangements to <strong>attend a few of the<br>
                most important conferences</strong> for the company. These must go off without a hitch.</p>
                <p>And the only other person who can help - the <em>one</em> expert we have at navigating these sorts of engagements - is
                moving to Europe in a week.</p>
                <p>Actually, this planing should have been started two weeks ago...thanks for taking the reins on this one, Michael!</p><br>
              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Objectives:</h3>
                <p>Objective #1: Plan company <strong>attendance at conferences</strong>, as a driving aspect of the lead generation strategy.</p>

                <p>Objective #2: Prepare <strong>logistics</strong> (e.g. transportation, shipping, insurance).</p>

                <p>Objective #3: Execute on supporting pre/post <strong>communications strategies</strong>.</p>

                <p>Objective #4: Figure out how to <strong>automate this process</strong>, for future engagements.</p><br>


              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Unique Insight:</h3>
                <p>I quickly realized <strong>no formal process</strong> had been developed.</p>
                <p>All I had was various tidbits of information causally passed
                down from my superiors, and they really only ever oversaw the process.
                Besides, they had their own all-encompassing tasks like
                engineering and business development to handle.</p>

                <p>Luckily, my overseas-bound colleague passed on a few insightful tips prior to her departure -
                so, there were at least a few ropes to grasp onto before I jumped headfirst into anything:</p>

                <p><strong>Order was important</strong> - that's to say I might not be able to accomplish<br> <em>task x</em>
                without first doing <em>task y</em>.</p>

                <p>Related to this, <strong>prioritization was essential</strong>.
                Some items had to be initiated two months in advance (e.g. design & printing).
                Others could only commence the week of the event<br> (e.g. insurance policy signings).</p>

                <p><strong>Costs</strong> were to be minimized.</p>

                <p>Seriously, conferences are awfully expensive
                ($7,500 to <em>rent</em> a weekend's worth of carpeting for
                a 200 square foot space? $1,500 for a table and chairs
                that scream<br> "We just got back from IKEA"?! Yeah, no thank you -
                we'll purchase and bring our own).</p>

                <p>Some <strong>vendors</strong> just <em>suck</em> when it comes to timeline, helpfulness, and negotiating.</p>

                <p><strong>Conference administrators</strong> can be helpful, up to a point. But they're busy.</p>

                <p>Each event has <strong>different rules and regulations</strong> (i.e. hoops that attendees must be aware of and jump through).</p>

                <p>Needless to say - for the first go-round - I knew this would be frustrating, hard work.
                But<br> it would be worth it to plow through and <strong>meticulously track my efforts and outcomes</strong>,
                in a concerted effort to make future iterations as <strong>automatic and stress-free as possible</strong>.</p><br>

              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Plan:</h3>
                <p><strong>Wrangle the disjointed splattering of notes</strong> I've pieced together from colleagues.
                Don't be afraid to ask bosses <em>some</em> questions about how things have been done in the past.</p>

                <p>Based on this information, <strong>plan everything</strong> involved with our conference attendance<br> as best I could.</p>

                <p><strong>Track my activities</strong> meticulously.</p>

                <p>Develop a coherent, <strong>checklist-centric guide</strong> that will make this task more pleasant in the future.</p>

                <p>Use a cloud-based platform (Dropbox Paper) to enable <strong>easy collaboration</strong>.</p>

                <p>Keep the list items <strong>just specific enough to effectively automate processes</strong>, but no more than necessary.
                This is to keep cognitive load low while handling variance<br>
                in event-specific rules & regulations.</p><br>

              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Results:</h3>
                <p>Meticulously tracking my tasks when planning those first conferences
                went just as expected - stressful, but manageable. <strong>Things got done</strong>.</p>

                <p>We attended the conferences; they were, by all accounts, a remarkable <strong>success</strong>.
                Prospects loved the display of our new products, we made long-lasting personal connections,
                and <strong>didn't hit any major logistical snags</strong>.</p>

                <p>Navigating the trade show setup went from a serious pain in the backside - to a largely effortless,
                <strong>efficient, and repeatable process</strong>.</p>

                <p>Jobs to be done are now <strong>clearly laid out</strong>, yet modifiable for unexpected happenings.</p>

                <p>Marketing's creative capabilities are now fully in-use, no longer hampered by logistical nightmares.
                I'd estimate that my internal document sparked a <strong>67% increase in happiness</strong> when it came to their
                day-to-day existence at work.</p>
