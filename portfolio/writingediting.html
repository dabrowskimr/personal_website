          </div>

              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Overview:</h3>
                <p>Great content is important for any organization, but for
                <strong>SaaS-based sales business intelligence solutions</strong>
                - it's absolutely <em>essential</em>.</p>
                <p>That's because the people who purchase these solutions (<strong>sales leaders</strong>) are<br> a specific
                type of individual.</p>
                <p>They're confident, outgoing, and insist on data-driven, <strong>results-oriented decision making</strong> in every
                aspect of their professional life.</p>
                <p>Datanyze commissioned me to <strong>interview successful sales representatives</strong>,
                and then <strong>write an eBook</strong> (along with several blog posts) <strong>to spread their knowledge</strong>.</p>
                <p>Doing so would continue to bolster their brand as a <strong>thought leader</strong>
                in their vertical (business intelligence solutions for SaaS companies).</p>
                <p>Ideally, it would also function as <strong>onboarding material
                for new biz dev hires</strong> throughout the SaaS community.</p>
                <br>

              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Target Audience:</h3>
                <p>Sales managers & oncoming sales hires.</p><br>
              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Audience Messaging:</h3>
              <p>Modern SaaS sales teams speak to one another in a hyper-direct <strong>tone</strong> that's
              <strong>concise, realistic</strong>, and targets the data-driven, <strong>results-oriented</strong> world they live in.</p><br>
              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Competitive Insight:</h3>
                <p>The business intelligence SaaS solution world is a <strong>crowded marketplace</strong>,
                with numerous companies creating remarkably <strong>similar products and relevant content</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>Real-world knowledge</strong> that stems <strong>directly from sales professionals</strong> is the only
                type of writing that is respected amongst target audiences.</p><br>

              <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Plan:</h3>
                <p>Research <strong>current trends</strong> in modern sales development.</p>
                <p><strong>Get in touch with sales reps</strong> at top SaaS companies and
                see if theyâ€™d be interested in contributing.</p>
                <p>Ensure interview deadlines are met.<p>
                <p><strong>Write</strong>.</p>
                <p>Work with our eBook partner Hubspot's <strong>design team</strong> on layout
                ideas that <strong>present my writing in an optimal way</strong>.</p>
                <p>Approve design and <strong>publish</strong>.</p><br>
