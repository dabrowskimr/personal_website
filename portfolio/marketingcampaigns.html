    <div class="portfolioexample">
      <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Objectives:</h3>
        <p>Objective #1: Redesign outdated website and implement a <strong>cohesive
          marketing strategy</strong> to create a modern communications
          funnel.</p>
        <p>Objective #2: Highlight <strong>new products</strong> while increasing industry <strong>brand awareness.</strong></p>
        <p>Objective #3: <strong>Generate warm leads</strong> so that sales will have better
        conversations with prospects.</p><br>
      <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Target Audience:</h3>
        <p><strong>Academic researchers</strong> (primarily neuroscientists)
           with grant money to spare.<br><br>
          Their primary driver in choosing a system
           is based on arguably two concerns:<br> "can it accomplish what I need to do <em>right now</em>",
           and "how adaptable is it for<br>
           <em>future experiments?</em>"</p><br>
      <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Audience Messaging:</h3>
        <p>I decided to highlight Ripple's <strong>unique value offerings</strong>:
        <strong>extremely customizable systems</strong>, and <strong>delightful customer service</strong>
        representatives who help scientists navigate the complex process of integrating
        new technology with their existing workflow.</p><br>
      <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Competitive Insight:</h3>
        <p>Their competitors rarely pay much attention to direct marketing,
        and instead rely on word of mouth or trade show attendance. Most of their
        <strong>websites are outdated</strong>, and very few have a coherent communications
        strategy.</p>
        <p>Presenting a <strong>clean, user-focused website</strong> that highlights
        what customers can do with their systems would immediately set Ripple
        ahead of its competition.</p>
        <p>Also, since <strong>trade shows</strong> play such an integral role in the sales
        process of these devices,<br> I knew a significant part of the marketing budget
        should be dedicated to creating <strong>pre/post-show email marketing</strong> & quality
        <strong>print materials</strong> to distribute in person.</p><br>
      <h3 style="font-family: futura;">Plan:</h3>
        <p>Craft effective messaging and <strong>brand guidelines</strong> to leverage across channels.</p>
        <p>Hire a web design firm to develop a product-centric <strong>web presence</strong>.</p>
        <p>Develop <strong>email marketing</strong> timeline and strategies</p>
        <p>Go all out on <strong>trade show marketing.</strong> Host parties. Give away prizes in exchange for contact information.</p>
        <p>Analyze <strong>web traffic</strong> before, during, and after
        marketing pushes.</p>
        <p>Remain in constant contact with <strong>sales teams</strong> to ensure customer-centric
        marketing strategies align with their insight from the field.</p><br>
